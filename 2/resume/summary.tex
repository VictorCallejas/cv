I am a last year student on a bachelor's of computer science at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.

Lover of new technologies and progress. I am passionate about continuous learning, I do so by participating in competitions on Kaggle and DrivenData where I can learn and apply state of the art techniques to real problems, doing online courses on platforms as Coursera, reading papers...

In my free time I like running, value investing and learn more about fields I am passionate about such as Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and DevOps.
